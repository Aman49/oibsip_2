            <hr>
            <p>Srinivas Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of number theory and infinite series. Born in 1887 in Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan was largely self-taught and had an innate talent for mathematics.</p>

            <p>Ramanujan's work has had a profound impact on mathematics and continues to inspire mathematicians today. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918 and was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian award, in 1954. In 2012, the Government of India declared December 22, Ramanujan's birthday, as National Mathematics Day.</p>
